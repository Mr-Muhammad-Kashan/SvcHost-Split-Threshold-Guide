‚ùî The Problem: Service Grouping & Instability
In Windows, the svchost.exe (Service Host) process is used to group multiple services into a single process. While this was designed to save memory on older systems, on modern PCs it can lead to stability issues. If one service in a group crashes, it can terminate the entire svchost.exe process, taking down all other unrelated services hosted within it. This can cause system-wide errors and instability.

‚úÖ The Solution: Service Isolation
This tool provides an interactive guide and calculator for the SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB registry value. By setting this value to a number higher than your total system RAM, you force Windows to run each eligible service in its own separate, isolated svchost.exe process.

This leads to:

Enhanced Stability: A crash in one service no longer affects others.

Better Transparency: You can easily see the individual resource usage of each service in the Task Manager.

Easier Troubleshooting: Problematic services can be identified and managed with ease.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive Value Calculator: Instantly calculate the precise registry value based on your system's RAM in GB.

Dual Value Display: Automatically provides both the Decimal and Hexadecimal values required for the registry.

One-Click Copy: Easily copy the generated values to your clipboard to prevent typos.

In-Depth Knowledge Base: A clean, tabbed interface provides comprehensive information on:

The core concepts and benefits.

The pros and cons of the tweak.

A clear guide on who should (and shouldn't) apply this change.

A step-by-step "military-grade" procedure for applying the value.

Reference Tables: Quick lookup tables for common RAM configurations.

Fully Responsive: A clean and modern UI that works flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Self-Contained: The entire application is a single HTML file with no dependencies, making it extremely portable.

üéØ Who Is This For?
This tool is designed for:

Power Users & PC Enthusiasts

Gamers seeking maximum system stability.

System Administrators & IT Professionals

Developers who need a stable and isolated service environment.

Anyone troubleshooting system instability or high svchost.exe resource usage.

Editing the Windows Registry can be risky. While the procedure outlined in this guide is a well-documented and generally safe optimization for modern systems, you should always proceed with caution.

It is highly recommended that you create a System Restore Point or a full system backup before making any changes to the registry. The author and contributors of this project are not responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur. Use this tool and guide at your own risk.
