## ❔ The Problem: Service Grouping & Instability

In Windows, the `svchost.exe` (Service Host) process is used to group multiple services into a single process.  
While this was designed to save memory on older systems, on modern PCs it can lead to stability issues.  

If one service in a group crashes, it can terminate the entire `svchost.exe` process, taking down all other unrelated services hosted within it. This can cause system-wide errors and instability.

## ✅ The Solution: Service Isolation

This tool provides an interactive guide and calculator for the `SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB` registry value.  
By setting this value to a number higher than your total system RAM, you force Windows to run each eligible service in its own separate, isolated `svchost.exe` process.

### 🧠 Benefits

- **Enhanced Stability**: A crash in one service no longer affects others.
- **Better Transparency**: Easily see individual resource usage in Task Manager.
- **Easier Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify and manage problematic services.
